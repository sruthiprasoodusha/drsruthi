## Dr. Sruthi Prasood Usha, Humboldt Fellow, Postdoctoral Research Scientist, Chair for Bioinspired Materials and Biosensor Technologies
Since her PhD, Sruthiâ€™s research focus is fiber optic biosensors, optoelectronics, surface chemistry development, and functional materials. In February 2023, she startet in the working group Chair for Bioinspired Materials and Biosensor Technologies, Kiel University, in the interdisciplinary EIC-funded project, SOILMONITOR. The project is aimed at developing a highly miniaturized sensor system for continuous soil-nutrient monitoring based on the integration of a lab-on-a-chip microfluidic cartridge with an optoelectronic detection unit. Moreover, since February 2024, she is working on the project "Prediction of Wheeze Prognosis in Children through the Development of a Smart Fiber Optic Chemo-Sensor Platform for In-Home Breath Profiling" as a Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellow.
