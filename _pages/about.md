I am a researcher specializing in Applied Optics and Materials Engineering, focused on developing Customized Nano-Interfaces and Sensor Platforms for medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and agro-food safety. With a deep expertise in fiber optics, sensor engineering, nanotechnology, and material science, I have created robust optical sensing platforms that address specific targets by optimizing transducer-receptor interfaces. My work includes designing miniaturized, disposable fiber optic probes and ultra-compact labs for precise, on-site measurements, ideal for chem-bio-sensing and point-of-care testing.

Currently, I am leading an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation-funded project aimed at developing a Lab-on-a-Tip Fiber system for respiratory disease prognosis through breathomics. Additionally, as part of the EU SOILMONITOR project, I am creating chemical assays for soil nutrient detection, incorporating bioinspired materials like nanozymes and ion-imprinted polymers, along with MOFs and COFs, designed for integration with lab-on-a-chip microfluidic cartridges and optoelectronic systems.
