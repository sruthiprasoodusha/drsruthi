I am an early career researcher specializing in Fiber Optic Sensor Research. Currently, I work with Prof. Dr. Zeynep Altintas at Christian-Albrechts-Universit√§t zu Kiel, developing a continuous soil nutrient sensor to enhance agriculture by providing real-time soil nutrient data. This innovation helps farmers optimize fertilization and irrigation, promoting sustainable crop production.

Previously, I was a National Postdoctoral Researcher at the Biosensors Laboratory, IIT Madras, funded by SERB, DST, Government of India, under Dr. V. V. Raghavendra Sai. I earned my PhD from IIT Delhi in Prof. B. D. Gupta's Fiber Optic Sensors lab. I also served as an Institute Postdoctoral Fellow and Senior Project Scientist at IIT Madras.

I have extensive experience in R&D, peer review, scientific editing, project management, and grant proposal submissions. I review for Elsevier and Royal Society of Chemistry journals and have a decade of experience publishing research articles. I am well-versed in the peer-review process and manuscript handling systems.
